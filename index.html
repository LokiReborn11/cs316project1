              They shall be of iron will and steely sinew. In great armour I shall clad them and with the mightiest weapons shall they be armed. 
              They will be untouched by plague or disease; no sickness shall blight them. 
              They shall have such tactics, strategies and machines that no foe will best them in battle. They are my bulwark against the Terror. 
              They are the Defenders of Humanity. They are my Space Marines...and they shall know no fear."
